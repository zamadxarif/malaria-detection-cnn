# Portfolio of projects - Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree

This repository highlights jupyter notebooks for projects completed as part of Udacity's Machine Learning Nanodegree as of June 2019. The final certificate can be found here: https://graduation.udacity.com/confirm/JM3NPKV

The course goes through projects related to supervised, unsupervised, deep and reinforcement learning using Python. It also includes a capstone project which attempts to replicate or add to the literature. All projects are reviewed by experts in the field. These reviews have also been added to this repository.

## 1. Capstone project - Classifying malaria infected cells using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).



## 2. Predicting income with Census data using supervised learning.



## 3. Creating customer segments using unsupervised learning.



## 4. Classifying dog breeds using deep learning.



## 5. Teaching a quadcopter to fly using reinforcement learning.
