# malaria-detection-cnn
This repository contains jupyter notebooks and final write ups for my capstone project on detecting malaria infection using CNNs.

The software used for this project includes Python (coding) and Latex (write up).

Python libraries include:
- Sklearn
- Keras
- Numpy
- Tensorflow (as a backend for Keras)

The data was obtained from the following sources:
